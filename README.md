Backpropagation exercise- Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Exercise
  
Now you're going to implement the backprop algorithm for a network trained on the graduate school admission data.  
  
The goals here:  
  
- Implement the forward pass.
- Implement the backpropagation algorithm.
- Update the weights.
